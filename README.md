# Cert_Reviews
This repo is used to provide reviews of the certifications I have taken. 
All thoughts and opinions are personal, so make sure to tailor your certifications to your interests and desires, and research further into certs that interest you.
Something I dislike you may really enjoy, and vice versa.

I am currently creating reviews for the following certifications:
- Sec+
- CySA+
- PenTest+
- CyberSec First Responder (CFR)
- CSI Linux Certified OSINT Analyst
- Microsoft SC-900
- INE Certified Cloud Associate
- ISC(2) Entry Level Certification
- MITRE MAD (4 certs currently available; CTI, Threat Hunting, Adversary Emulation, SOC Assessment)

#MITRE ATT&CK Defender (MAD) Cyber Threat Intelligence Certification

The MAD CTI certification is apart of the MITRE Engenuity MAD training program. Users must pay an annual payment of $499 to access all of the certifications offered by MITRE (4 currently). You can just pay once, complete all of the certs in one year, and then pay again some years down the road when information is outdated or changed, that is my plan. 

Unlike standard certifications, these certs are obtained by completing smaller assesssments, not one big test. As an added bonus, the training is available freely through Cybrary, so you only have to pay to acquire the certifications. You can take the training before you pay and decide for yourself if it is worth it or not to become officially certified. 

The CTI certification requires completion of 4 assessment modules, seen below:

Each module hit on different aspects of using MITRE ATT&CK for intelligence.
