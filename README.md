# Cert_Reviews
This repo is used to provide reviews of the certifications I have taken. 
All thoughts and opinions are personal, so make sure to tailor your certifications to your interests and desires, and research further into certs that interest you.
Something I dislike you may really enjoy, and vice versa.

I am currently creating reviews for the following certifications:
- Sec+
- CySA+
- PenTest+
- CyberSec First Responder (CFR)
- CSI Linux Certified OSINT Analyst
- INE Certified Cloud Associate
- ISC(2) Entry Level Certification
- MITRE MAD (4 certs currently available; CTI, Threat Hunting, Adversary Emulation, SOC Assessment)
